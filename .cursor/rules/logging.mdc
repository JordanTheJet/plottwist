globs: *

# Functions
- Use `debugLog` for information, `errorLog` for errors
- First parameter: current function name as string
- Messages: concise, descriptive, with relevant metrics

# Style
- Use present progressive verbs ("Processing", "Generating")
- Include counts when applicable ("Processing 5 files")
- For batches, include progress ("Processing batch 1/5")
- For errors, include context (file path, specific error)
- Separate logs from code with empty lines for readability

# Hierarchy
- Avoid redundant logging between parent and child functions
- Log at the level where work is being done
- Parent functions: log high-level operations
- Child functions: log details

# Examples
```typescript
// Debug logs
debugLog("functionName", `Processing ${items.length} files`);
debugLog("functionName", `Found ${results.length} results`);

// Error logs
errorLog("functionName", `Error processing file: ${filePath}`, error);
```
