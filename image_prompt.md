Color illustrated portrait, set in a specific setting, showing 2 characters in the foreground, standing still and looking at the viewer as if to start a conversation with them:

Setting: In the fog-laden, gaslit streets of Victorian London, 221B Baker Street exudes a timeless aura of mystery where every creaking floorboard whispers secrets of unsolved enigmas.

Character 1 (Sherlock Holmes): A tall, lean figure with sharply chiseled features, penetrating grey eyes, a prominent aquiline nose, and sleek dark hair, typically attired in a meticulously tailored Victorian suit complete with his signature hat and Inverness cape.

Character 2 (Watson): A tall, lean man with sharply defined features, piercing grey eyes, a prominent aquiline nose, and neatly styled dark hair, habitually clad in a finely tailored Victorian suit complete with his iconic deerstalker hat and Inverness cape.
